Introduction

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):
Length of the sepals
Width of the sepals
Length of the petals
Width of the petals
Working of the iris_decision_tree_classifier

The program takes data from the training data set.
The program then divides the dataset into training and testing samples in 80:20 ratio randomly using train_test_learn() function available in sklearn module.
The program then creates a decision tree,Naive Bayes and SVM.
Accuracy score is then calculated by comparing with the correct results of the training dataset.



The program applies the best machine learning model onto testing data set csv.
The program then divides the dataset into training and testing samples in 80:20 ratio randomly using train_test_learn() function available in sklearn module.
The training sample space is used to train the program and predictions are made on the testing sample space.
